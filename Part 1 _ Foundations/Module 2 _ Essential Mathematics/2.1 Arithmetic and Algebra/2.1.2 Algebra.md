# 🧮 Unlocking the Language of Math: Algebra Essentials 📐

Welcome back, future AI innovator! Now that we've solidified our understanding of arithmetic, let's move on to the next crucial building block: **algebra**. This module will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of algebra, which are essential for expressing and manipulating mathematical relationships in AI and machine learning.

## What is Algebra? 🤔

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols (usually letters) to represent numbers and quantities. It provides a powerful way to express general mathematical relationships, solve equations, and manipulate mathematical expressions. In AI, algebra is used to represent data, models, and algorithms, making it a core skill for any aspiring AI practitioner.

## Basic Algebraic Expressions ✍️

Let's start with the basics:

1. **Variables:** Symbols (usually lowercase letters like $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$) that represent unknown or changing quantities.
   - Example: In the expression $2x + 3$, $x$ is a variable.
2. **Constants:** Fixed numerical values that do not change.
   - Example: In the expression $2x + 3$, `2` and `3` are constants.
3. **Terms:** A term is a single number, a variable, or numbers and variables multiplied together.
   - Example: In the expression $2x + 3y - 5$, $2x$, $3y$, and $-5$ are terms.
4. **Coefficients:** The numerical factor of a term that contains a variable.
   - Example: In the term $2x$, `2` is the coefficient.
5. **Expressions:** A combination of terms connected by mathematical operations.
   - Example: $2x + 3y - 5$, $a^2 + b^2$, $\frac{x+1}{y}$

## Algebraic Operations ➕➖✖️➗

Algebra uses the same basic operations as arithmetic, but with variables and expressions:

1. **Addition (+):** Combining like terms.
   - Example: $2x + 3x = 5x$
   - In general: If we have two expressions, $A$ and $B$, their sum is denoted as $A + B$.
2. **Subtraction (-):** Finding the difference between like terms.
   - Example: $5y - 2y = 3y$
   - In general: If we have two expressions, $A$ and $B$, their difference is denoted as $A - B$.
3. **Multiplication (× or \*):** Multiplying terms using the distributive property.
   - Example: $2(x + 3) = 2x + 6$
   - In general: If we have two expressions, $A$ and $B$, their product is denoted as $A \times B$ or $A * B$.
4. **Division (÷ or /):** Dividing terms using the properties of fractions.
   - Example: $\frac{6x}{2} = 3x$
   - In general: If we have two expressions, $A$ and $B$ (where $B \ne 0$), their quotient is denoted as $A \div B$ or $A / B$.

## Equations and Inequalities ⚖️

Algebra is used to express and solve equations and inequalities:

1. **Equations:** A statement that two expressions are equal, denoted by the symbol `=`.
   - Example: $2x + 5 = 11$
   - In general: If we have two expressions, $A$ and $B$, an equation is denoted as $A = B$.
2. **Inequalities:** A statement that two expressions are not equal, denoted by symbols like `>`, `<`, $\ge$, or $\le$.
   - Example: $x + 3 > 7$
   - In general: If we have two expressions, $A$ and $B$, an inequality can be denoted as $A > B$, $A < B$, $A \ge B$, or $A \le B$.

## Solving Linear Equations 🧩

A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. Here's how to solve them:

1. **Isolate the Variable:** Use algebraic operations to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
2. **Apply Inverse Operations:** Use inverse operations to undo the operations applied to the variable.

   - Example: Solve for $x$ in the equation $2x + 5 = 11$.

     1. Subtract 5 from both sides:
        $2x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5$
        $2x = 6$
     2. Divide both sides by 2:
        $\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{6}{2}$
        $x = 3$

## Solving Quadratic Equations 🧮

A quadratic equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 2. A general form of quadratic equation is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

1. **Factoring:** Factor the quadratic equation into two linear expressions and set each to zero.
   - Example: $x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x+2)(x+3) = 0$, so $x=-2$ or $x=-3$
2. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:

   - $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

   - Example: Solve for $x$ in the equation $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$.

     1. Identify $a=1$, $b=-4$, and $c=3$.
     2. Apply the quadratic formula:
        $x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)}$
        $x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 12}}{2}$
        $x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2}$
        $x = \frac{4 \pm 2}{2}$
        $x = 3$ or $x = 1$

## Introduction to Sets

A set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.

1. **Set Notation:** Sets are typically denoted using curly braces `{}`.
   - Example: $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $B = \{a, b, c\}$
2. **Set Operations:**
   - **Union ($A \cup B$):** The set of all elements that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.
     - Example: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.
   - **Intersection ($A \cap B$):** The set of all elements that are in both $A$ and $B$.
     - Example: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then $A \cap B = \{3\}$.
   - **Difference ($A - B$):** The set of all elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.
     - Example: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then $A - B = \{1, 2\}$.
   - **Subset ($A \subseteq B$):** All elements of A are also in B.
     - Example: If $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then $A \subseteq B$.
   - **Superset ($A \supseteq B$):** All elements of B are also in A.
     - Example: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{1, 2\}$, then $A \supseteq B$.
