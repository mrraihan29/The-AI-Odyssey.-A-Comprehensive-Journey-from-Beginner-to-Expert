# ➗ The Foundation of Numbers: Arithmetic Essentials ➕

Welcome back, future AI architect! Before we delve into the complex algorithms and neural networks that power AI, let's revisit the fundamental building blocks of mathematics: **arithmetic**. This module will ensure you have a solid grasp of the basic operations and concepts that underpin all quantitative reasoning in AI.

## What is Arithmetic? 🤔

At its core, arithmetic is the branch of mathematics that deals with numbers and their basic operations. These operations form the bedrock for all mathematical and statistical computations, making them essential for understanding and implementing AI algorithms.

## Basic Operations ➕➖✖️➗

Let's review the four fundamental arithmetic operations:

1. **Addition (+):** Combining two or more numbers to find their sum.
   - Example: `5 + 3 = 8`
   - In general: If we have two numbers, $a$ and $b$, their sum is denoted as $a + b$.
2. **Subtraction (-):** Finding the difference between two numbers.
   - Example: `10 - 4 = 6`
   - In general: If we have two numbers, $a$ and $b$, their difference is denoted as $a - b$.
3. **Multiplication (× or \*):** Repeated addition of a number by itself a specified number of times.
   - Example: `4 × 6 = 24` or `4 * 6 = 24`
   - In general: If we have two numbers, $a$ and $b$, their product is denoted as $a \times b$ or $a * b$.
4. **Division (÷ or /):** Finding how many times one number is contained within another.
   - Example: `15 ÷ 3 = 5` or `15 / 3 = 5`
   - In general: If we have two numbers, $a$ and $b$ (where $b \ne 0$), their quotient is denoted as $a \div b$ or $a / b$.

## Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) 🧮

When an expression contains multiple operations, we need to follow a specific order to get the correct result. The order of operations is commonly remembered using the acronyms **PEMDAS** (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) or **BODMAS** (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction):

1. **Parentheses/Brackets (P/B):** Operations inside parentheses or brackets are performed first.
   - Example: `(5 + 3) × 2 = 8 × 2 = 16`
2. **Exponents/Orders (E/O):** Exponents or orders (powers and roots) are performed next.
   - Example: `2^3 = 8` or `√9 = 3`
3. **Multiplication and Division (M/D):** Multiplication and division are performed from left to right.
   - Example: `10 / 2 × 3 = 5 × 3 = 15`
4. **Addition and Subtraction (A/S):** Addition and subtraction are performed from left to right.
   - Example: `10 + 5 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12`

## Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages 🔢

These are different ways of representing numbers:

1. **Fractions:** Represent a part of a whole, denoted as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is the numerator and $b$ is the denominator.
   - Example: $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{5}{7}$
2. **Decimals:** Represent numbers using a decimal point to separate the whole part from the fractional part.
   - Example: `0.5`, `3.14`, `12.75`
3. **Percentages:** Represent a proportion or ratio as a fraction of 100, denoted by the symbol %.
   - Example: `50%`, `75%`, `120%`

## Exponents and Logarithms 📈

These are important concepts for understanding mathematical relationships:

1. **Exponents:** Represent repeated multiplication of a number by itself.
   - In general: $a^b$ means $a$ multiplied by itself $b$ times.
   - Example: $2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$
2. **Logarithms:** Represent the inverse operation of exponentiation.
   - In general: $\log_b a = c$ means $b^c = a$.
   - Example: $\log_2 8 = 3$ because $2^3 = 8$.

## Mathematical Notation and Symbols ✍️

Throughout this module, we'll use various mathematical notations and symbols. Here are some common ones:

- **Numbers:**
  - $\mathbb{N}$: Set of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)
  - $\mathbb{Z}$: Set of integers (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)
  - $\mathbb{Q}$: Set of rational numbers (fractions)
  - $\mathbb{R}$: Set of real numbers
  - $\mathbb{C}$: Set of complex numbers
- **Variables:**
  - Lowercase letters (e.g., $a$, $b$, $x$, $y$) usually represent scalar values.
  - Bold lowercase letters (e.g., $\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{w}$) usually represent vectors.
  - Bold uppercase letters (e.g., $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$) usually represent matrices.
- **Operations:**
  - $+$: Addition
  - $-$: Subtraction
  - $\times$ or $*$ : Multiplication
  - $\div$ or $/$ : Division
  - $=$: Equality
  - $\ne$: Not equal to
  - $>$: Greater than
  - $<$: Less than
  - $\ge$: Greater than or equal to
  - $\le$: Less than or equal to
- **Functions:**
  - $f(x)$: Function of $x$
  - $\log(x)$: Logarithm of $x$
  - $\exp(x)$ or $e^x$: Exponential of $x$
  - $\sqrt{x}$: Square root of $x$
