# üöÄ Vectors and Matrices: The Building Blocks of Data üìä

Welcome back, AI explorer! Now that we've covered the fundamentals of arithmetic and algebra, let's dive into the world of **linear algebra**, starting with the essential concepts of **vectors and matrices**. These mathematical objects are the fundamental building blocks for representing and manipulating data in AI and machine learning.

## What are Vectors? ü§î

A **vector** is a mathematical object that has both magnitude (length) and direction. Think of it as an arrow in space. In the context of data, vectors are used to represent features, attributes, or data points.

### Representing Vectors

- **Column Vector:** A vector represented as a column of numbers.

  $$
  \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
  v_1 \\
  v_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  v_n
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  - Here, $\mathbf{v}$ is a vector with $n$ components, denoted as $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$.

- **Row Vector:** A vector represented as a row of numbers.

  $$
  \mathbf{v}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
  v_1 & v_2 & \cdots & v_n
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  - $\mathbf{v}^T$ is the transpose of the column vector $\mathbf{v}$.

### Examples of Vectors in AI

- **Feature Vector:** A vector that represents the features of a data point. For example, a feature vector for a house might include the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.

  $$
  \mathbf{house} = \begin{bmatrix}
  3 \\
  1500 \\
  \text{"Suburb"}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

- **Word Embedding:** A vector that represents the meaning of a word in a high-dimensional space.

  $$
  \mathbf{word} = \begin{bmatrix}
  0.247 \\
  -0.512 \\
  0.731 \\
  0.841 \\
  -0.156
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  _Example: The word "word" encoded in a 5-dimensional space_

### Geometric Interpretation of Vectors

Geometrically, vectors can be visualized as arrows in space.

- **2D Vector:** In a 2D space, a vector can be represented as an arrow from the origin to a point $(x, y)$.

  $$
  \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
  x \\
  y
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

- **3D Vector:** In a 3D space, a vector can be represented as an arrow from the origin to a point $(x, y, z)$.

  $$
  \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
  x \\
  y \\
  z
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

## What are Matrices? ü§î

A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are used to represent data, transformations, and relationships in AI.

### Representing Matrices

- **Matrix Notation:** A matrix is usually denoted by a bold uppercase letter (e.g., $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$).

  $$
  \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
  a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
  a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  - Here, $\mathbf{A}$ is a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns, with elements denoted as $a_{ij}$.

### Types of Matrices

- **Square Matrix:** A matrix with the same number of rows and columns ($m = n$).

  $$
  \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
  a_{11} & a_{12} \\
  a_{21} & a_{22}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

- **Identity Matrix:** A square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

  $$
  \mathbf{I} = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

- **Zero Matrix:** A matrix with all elements equal to zero.

  $$
  \mathbf{0} = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

### Examples of Matrices in AI

- **Data Matrix:** A matrix where each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature.

  $$
      \mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
      3 & 1500 & "Suburb" \\
      2 & 1200 & "City" \\
      4 & 2000 & "Rural"
      \end{bmatrix}
  $$

- **Transformation Matrix:** A matrix used to perform linear transformations on vectors.

  $$
      \mathbf{T} = \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 1 \\
      -1 & 3
      \end{bmatrix}
  $$
