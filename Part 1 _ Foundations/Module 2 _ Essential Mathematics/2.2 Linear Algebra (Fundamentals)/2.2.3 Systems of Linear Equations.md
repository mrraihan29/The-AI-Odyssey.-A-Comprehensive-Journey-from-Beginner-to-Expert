# üß© Solving the Puzzle: Systems of Linear Equations üìê

Welcome back, AI explorer! Building upon our understanding of vectors and matrices, let's now explore **systems of linear equations**. These systems are a cornerstone of linear algebra and are used to model and solve a wide range of problems in AI and machine learning.

## What are Systems of Linear Equations? ü§î

A **system of linear equations** is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. The goal is to find values for these variables that satisfy all equations simultaneously.

### Representing Systems of Linear Equations

- **General Form:** A system of $m$ linear equations with $n$ variables ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$) can be represented as:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n &= b_1 \\
  a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}x_n &= b_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{mn}x_n &= b_m
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  - Here, $a_{ij}$ are the coefficients, $x_i$ are the variables, and $b_i$ are the constants.

- **Matrix Form:** The same system can be represented in matrix form as:

  $$
  \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
  $$

  - Where:

    - $\mathbf{A}$ is the coefficient matrix ($m \times n$).
    - $\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of variables ($n \times 1$).
    - $\mathbf{b}$ is the vector of constants ($m \times 1$).

    $$
    \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
    \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    x_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    x_n
    \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
    b_1 \\
    b_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    b_m
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

### Examples of Systems of Linear Equations in AI

- **Linear Regression:** Finding the parameters of a linear model can be formulated as solving a system of linear equations.
- **Neural Networks:** The weights and biases of a neural network are often updated using techniques that involve solving systems of linear equations.
- **Linear Transformations:** Applying linear transformations to data can be represented as multiplying a matrix with a vector, which is a form of linear system.

## Solving Systems of Linear Equations üß©

There are several methods for solving systems of linear equations. Let's explore two common approaches:

### 1. Gaussian Elimination

Gaussian elimination is a systematic method for solving systems of linear equations by transforming the system into an equivalent, simpler form (row-echelon form or reduced row-echelon form) using elementary row operations.

- **Elementary Row Operations:**
  1.  Swapping two rows.
  2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.
  3.  Adding a multiple of one row to another row.
- **Steps:**

  1.  Write the system in matrix form as $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.
  2.  Form the augmented matrix $[\mathbf{A} | \mathbf{b}]$.
  3.  Use elementary row operations to transform the augmented matrix into row-echelon form or reduced row-echelon form.
  4.  Back-substitute to find the values of the variables.

  - Example: Solve the system:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    x + 2y &= 7 \\
    3x + 4y &= 15
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    1.  Matrix form:

        $$
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 \\
        3 & 4
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        x \\
        y
        \end{bmatrix} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        7 \\
        15
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$

    2.  Augmented matrix:

        $$
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 & | & 7 \\
        3 & 4 & | & 15
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$

    3.  Row operations:

        - Subtract 3 times row 1 from row 2:

          $$
          \begin{bmatrix}
          1 & 2 & | & 7 \\
          0 & -2 & | & -6
          \end{bmatrix}
          $$

        - Divide row 2 by -2:

          $$
          \begin{bmatrix}
          1 & 2 & | & 7 \\
          0 & 1 & | & 3
          \end{bmatrix}
          $$

        - Subtract 2 times row 2 from row 1:

          $$
          \begin{bmatrix}
          1 & 0 & | & 1 \\
          0 & 1 & | & 3
          \end{bmatrix}
          $$

    4.  Solution: $x = 1$, $y = 3$

### 2. Matrix Inversion

If the coefficient matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, we can solve the system $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ by multiplying both sides by the inverse of $\mathbf{A}$, denoted as $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}
$$

- **Matrix Inverse:** The inverse of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is a matrix $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ such that $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.
- **Steps:**

  1.  Write the system in matrix form as $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.
  2.  Find the inverse of the coefficient matrix $\mathbf{A}$, denoted as $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$.
  3.  Multiply both sides of the equation by $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ to obtain the solution $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}$.

  - Example: Solve the system with the same example above.
    1.  Matrix form:
        $$
        \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 \\
        3 & 4
        \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
        x \\
        y
        \end{bmatrix}, \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
        7 \\
        15
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$
    2.  Find the inverse of $\mathbf{A}$, which is:
        $$
        \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
        -2 & 1 \\
        1.5 & -0.5
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$
    3.  Multiply $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ with $\mathbf{b}$:
        $$
        \begin{bmatrix}
        x \\
        y
        \end{bmatrix} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        -2 & 1 \\
        1.5 & -0.5
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        7 \\
        15
        \end{bmatrix} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        -2*7 + 1*15 \\
        1.5*7 - 0.5*15
        \end{bmatrix} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 \\
        3
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$
    4.  Solution: $x = 1$, $y = 3$
